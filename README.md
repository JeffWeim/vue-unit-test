# vue-unit-test

### To start tests, run the command: `npm run dev`

- Unit testing for VueJS components using [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha), [Sinon Stub Promise](https://github.com/substantial/sinon-stub-promise), and [Sinon Chai](https://github.com/domenic/sinon-chai)

- A Karma Debug Runnner window can be opened at `http://localhost:9876/debug.html` after the command `npm run test` has been started (useful for setting breakpoints and stepping through the test's code)

- A coverage reporter is included. To view go to `.../test/unit/coverage/Icov-report/index.html`, right-click `index-html` and open in a browser
